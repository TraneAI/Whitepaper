#### We are accelerating AI innovation with the first decentralized network for AI and machine learning. Built on the blockchain. Powered by the TPAI token

We are building the first decentralized network for AI training on the blockchain.

The Transaction Protocol for Artificial Intelligence (TPAI) is an open source protocol that improves the efficiently of AI training. TPAI allows for an ecosystem of people who tag, store and model data to exchange the token as they collaborate together to innovate with AI. The utility of the token is based on a market for data services, and it all happens on the Ethereum blockchain.
